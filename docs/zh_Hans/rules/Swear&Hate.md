# ðŸ˜¡ Excessive swearing/hate speech

May be related to [Harassment](../harassment/)

In general, avoid using more than two swear words in one message

## **High**

* Repeated racial slurs or other forms of hate speech
  * For example, no hard Rs, but for the most part your intent is more important, though because oneâ€™s intent is subjective, it is fully up to the mods to decide even if the other person disagrees.
  * TL;DR for survival players: The more offensive you think it is, the higher the chance of punishment even if you disagree.
* Donâ€™t say very bad taste and offensive "jokes". If you are unsure a joke is allowed or not, donâ€™t say it, as it probably isnâ€™t.
