## **Is there a map download?**
No, because the map relies on the server's plugins to function. The map also
keeps our project alive and we do not want to segment the community! Map is only
given to people who knows what they are doing and they are contributing to the
project one way or another.

## **How big is the map?**
Our map is 21 Km wide and 26 Km in length

## **Is there a resource pack?**
Yes, there is. When you first join you will be asked if you want to
automatically download it whenever you join the server. You can also type
`/pack` in-game to download the pack and avoid loading times

## **How can I help?**
There is always thing to help out with! Find more info at: [REPLACE ME IN THE
FUTURE] Or ask in the respective channels!

## **How can I let you guys know about issues?**
For quick reports on survival, use ‚Å†#bug-reports, or if it regards a moderation
issue please contact the staff team in ‚Å†#staff-ticket.

## **I took a cool picture, where can I post it?**
We love this, just put them in ‚Å†#server-images, and we may use it for albums or
galleries.

## **Which social medias are you on?**
We are on quite a few social medias, see `‚Å†#üìå„Ä°information` for all the links!

## **I can't join the server?**
The server does not allow cracked accounts access to it, so that may be one
reason. Otherwise please open a ticket in #staff-contact with a screenshot of
the error-message you are getting, staff will help out as best they can.

## **Does this server has chat reporting on?**
No, and never will be.

## **I'm experiencing some connection issues?**
Yes, that might be case for wifi and slow internet users. We are highly
recommending either Ethernet or fast 5GHz or above internet connections.
