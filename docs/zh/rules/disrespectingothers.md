# ü§® Disrespecting others

## **‰∏•Èáç**

* Threats
  * We can be more lenient if it's obviously a joke, but if you're repeatedly
    joking at someone's expense, we will be a lot more strict
* Repeatedly ignoring requests from moderators
* Repeatedly targetting any specific member with toxic comments, builds, etc...

!!! info Warn: "Do not disrespect other members of the community" or "Do not
disrespect moderators"


!!! warning After 1-2 warnings, tempmute for 1 day, 1 week, 1 month (if repeated
offences are done through builds, ban for the time period instead of mute)
depending on severity


!!! danger Temp or perm ban based on severity and repetition
