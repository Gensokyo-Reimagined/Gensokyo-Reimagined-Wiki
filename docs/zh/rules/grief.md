# 💣 毁坏他人财产（熊）

While players are allowed to make houses that others can't grief (this rule
extends to all player structures), they may not claim absurdly large parts of
land as their own and forbid others from modifying them. There's a gray area,
but if we see issues we'll discuss them on a case-by-case basis.

Some examples of what can and can't be done: A town cannot be owned by one
singular person if many have contributed to it. You can't claim an entire
layer/section/landmarks/community hubs.

## **严重**

* 反复破坏某一特定区域
* 显著毁坏多栋房屋

!!! warning If there is a chance of misunderstanding, and this is a first major
offence, look in medium


!!! danger If enough evidence is present and grief is obviously of malicious
intent, permanent ban: "Griefing is not allowed on this server"


## **中等**

* 杀死他人驯服的动物
* 威胁要破坏他人财产
* 制造并不属于建筑的一部分的岩浆流/岩浆“瀑布”

!!! warning Tempban 1-3 day, 1-2 week, 1 month, escalate if repeated


!!! danger to high afterwards, not necessary to specifically have gone through
the day/week/month bans if the next offence fits into high.


## **轻微**

* 毁坏农田而不补种

!!! info Warn: "Please be a bit more careful with other players' builds and
avoid "


!!! warning If repeated offences continue (\~2 minor things), escalate to medium
