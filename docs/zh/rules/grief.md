# 💣 玩家间冲突

尽管玩家有权建造不受他人破坏的房屋（这里泛指所有玩家建造的建筑结构），但他们也不能荒谬地宣称大片土地为己有，并阻止其他人进行修改。这是一个灰色地带，然而如果确有此类事情发生，我们会逐个讨论。

Some examples of what can and can't be done: A town cannot be owned by one
singular person if many have contributed to it. You can't claim an entire
layer/section/landmarks/community hubs.

## **严重**

* 反复破坏某一特定区域
* 显著毁坏多栋房屋

!!! warning If there is a chance of misunderstanding, and this is a first major
offence, look in medium


!!! danger If enough evidence is present and grief is obviously of malicious
intent, permanent ban: "Griefing is not allowed on this server"


## **中等**

* 杀死他人驯服的动物
* 威胁要破坏他人财产
* 制造并不作为建筑的一部分的岩浆流/岩浆“瀑布”

!!! warning Tempban 1-3 day, 1-2 week, 1 month, escalate if repeated


!!! danger to high afterwards, not necessary to specifically have gone through
the day/week/month bans if the next offence fits into high.


## **轻微**

* 毁坏农田而不补种

!!! info Warn: "Please be a bit more careful with other players' builds and
avoid "


!!! warning If repeated offences continue (\~2 minor things), escalate to medium
