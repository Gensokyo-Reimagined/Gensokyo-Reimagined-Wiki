#resourcepack-general channel on Discord and ask for help.

#### <h3 style="color:purple;">Artist</h3>

Artists draw textures for various things in the resourcepack. This includes
mostly 2D designs such as GUIs, Items etc.

#### <h3 style="color:orange;">Modeller</h3>

Modellers mainly create custom mobs and weapons in 3D. Some people also
specialize in creating textures for Mobs, Furnitures etc. in Blockbench.

### <h3 style="color:red;">Art Lead</h3>

Decides what the general look of the resourcepack should be and gets other
artists to do stuff. Works with designers to figure out what models for things
need to be done and gives that work out to artists and modellers to do. Can also
make art and models of their own.
