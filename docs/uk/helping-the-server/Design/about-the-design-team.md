# ðŸ“‘ About the Design Team

### Purpose of the Design Team

* The design team was created to help build a roadmap and work on the ideas and concepts for the server whilst also implementing some of these features into survival such as new mobs.
* They work together to discuss ideas and build the core systems and mechanics that can then be produced to create a unique playable server.

### Public

* The public will also have access to the `#polls` channel where they can respond to design surveys given out by the Senior Designer to get a better understanding of what the player-base would appreciate, you can get the role to be pinged by these in the `#channels & roles` channel.
* Able to contribute thoughts and opinions in `#suggestions` so that the design team can think about and potentially look into. This is a good place for the player-base to share features they think would be useful or things that may present themselves as issues.

### Junior Designers

* Access to all the Design channels to be able to contribute to more official ideas and have more say in what will go into the official gameplay.
* Attend weekly(sorta) meetings
