## –ü—Ä–æ—á–µ–µ

EXP farms in the form of custom mobs or other vanilla (cactus farms and so on)
ones are not permitted, due to server lag issues. The same goes for farms for
mob drops.

## Respect Others

* No griefing or stealing others‚Äô belongings, private or not.
* No harassment of others
* No excessive swearing
* Respect moderators
* No repeated killing, or tricking others to their death

### Do not circumvent bans

You are not allowed to use alts to get around punishments

## Do not abuse exploits

Report bugs `#bug-reports` on Discord.

* If you are found exploiting a specific bug, you will be given a warning or
  temporary ban depending on the severity, increasing in length with repeated
  offenses.
* More info
  * If something happens to you randomly and or inconsistently, such as fall
    damage sometimes not working, you should still report it; if, for example,
    you know how to reproduce it, but we get that sometimes you can't really do
    anything about it.
  * In general, we aren't too severe with these unless it's blatant
    exploitation, such as item duplication.
* **We ask that you delete any duped items you still have!**\
  \
  See [Exploit abuse](exploitabuse.md).

## Do not spam or advertise in chat

* Do not self advertise for the purpose of advertising
* Do not send the same message repeatedly
* Do not spam emotes

This can also extend to DMs in some cases. Generally, you are free to talk about
whatever you like in DMs, as long the other party is okay with it, but spamming
someone privately, for example, still breaks this rule.\

See [üì¢Spam](spam.md)
