# ðŸ‘¥ About the Build Team

### Purpose of the Build Team

* The purpose of the build team is to keep our map looking beautiful and ever
  expanding! They are always working on new builds and structures to go into the
  Gensokyo.

### Public

* ~~Everyone is able to help the look of the Gensokyo in some way, for a start
  we host build events every few weeks on the weekends where people can help
  contribute to a concept the build team have set up and planned - these are
  posted with a time in `#events`, make sure to get the **build events role** in
  the `#channels & roles` channel to get pinged for these.~~ (will be added)
* We also have a discord channel, `#map-discussion`, which everyone has access
  to and can contribute ideas for things that should be built.
* ~~We also have an area, `/warp FreeBuild`, which is an area for anyone to
  build in and can be used for showcasing builds in your builder application.~~
  (will be added)

### Jr Builder

* You will need to apply in `#applications` using various builds from either
  build events, builds in Free Build or from your own work to showcase your
  skill.
* Junior Builders will build smaller scale buildings across the Gensokyo and
  help with smaller contributions towards larger projects.
* They do not immediately have access to World Edit or any of the building
  utensil plugins as they are abusable - however if the Builder is trusted and
  needs them for a certain build we will give them the permissions.
* To promote to a Builder, a Jr Builder needs to contribute often and gain
  sufficient trust from the Staff and Build Lead

### Builder

* Similar to Junior Builder but will have permanent access to World Edit and
  building tools.
* Will be contributing a bit more to the Gensokyo than Juniors and probably
  working on bigger projects.

### Build Lead

* In charge of the bigger projects, they will organize how they are run and who
  is working on them.
* They also are responsible for hosting build events and setting them up and
  making sure all the requirements are met for them to happen.
* Work closely with the Design and Dev team to make sure all gameplay aspects
  are met.
* In charge of the entire team and making sure the building progression in the
  Gensokyo is going smoothly.
